    <h2>WHAT IS CSS?</h2>
    <P>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red.

       CSS (<span class="bold underline">C</span class="bold underline">ascading <span class="bold underline">S</span>tyle <span class="bold underline">S</span>heets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.</P>

        CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.

        <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
        <h4 class=>Selector</h4>
        <p>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</p>
        <h4 id="CSS-declaration-subheading">Declaration</h4>
        <p>This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's <strong>properties</strong> you want to style.</p>
        <h4 id="CSS-property-value-heading">Property value</h4>
        <p>To the right of the property after the colon there is the <strong>property value</strong>. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
        <br/>

            <span id="take-note-nb">
                Note the other important parts of the syntax:
            </span>
        <br/>
        </br>
        <ul>
            <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
            <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
            <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
         </ul> </p>
